NAME
    URI::Template - Object for handling URI templates

SYNOPSIS
        use URI::Template;
        my $template = URI::Template->new( 'http://example.com/{x}' );
        my $uri      = $template->process( x => 'y' );
        # uri is a URI object with value 'http://example.com/y'

DESCRIPTION
    This is an initial attempt to provide a wrapper around URI templates as
    described at
    http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-gregorio-uritemplate-03.txt

INSTALLATION
        perl Makefile.PL
        make
        make test
        make install

METHODS
  new( $template )
    Creates a new URI::Template instance with the template passed in as the
    first parameter.

  template
    This method returns the original template string.

  variables
    Returns an array of unique variable names found in the template. NB:
    they are returned in random order.

  expansions
    This method returns an list of expansions found in the template.
    Currently, these are just coderefs. In the future, they will be more
    interesting.

  process( \%vars )
    Given a list of key-value pairs or an array ref of values (for
    positional substitution), it will URI escape the values and substitute
    them in to the template. Returns a URI object.

  process_to_string( \%vars )
    Processes input like the "process" method, but doesn't inflate the
    result to a URI object.
